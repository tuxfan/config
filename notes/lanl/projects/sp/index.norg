* Hyun Discussion
  - Need to look at xRage input deck to understand details
  -- Implosion dynamics, Richtmyer-Meshkov instatbilities
  -- xRage is ~40 hours for multigroup
  --- Unsplit hydro isn't as good
  -- Gordon Olson - Papers on multigroup diffusion
  - Doesn't care about structured vs. unstructured
